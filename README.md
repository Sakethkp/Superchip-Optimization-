# Superchip-Optimization
The report outlines the recommendations for Super Chip, a Virginia-based computer chip manufacturer, regarding their production and distribution operations for the upcoming fiscal year. The company has five manufacturing facilities with varying production capacity levels, and each facility has different equipment and setup costs that impact the cost of manufacturing each of the 30 types of computer chips. Additionally, there are variations in shipping costs for distributing the computer chips to 23 sales regions across the US. The report evaluates an alternative production policy that could potentially reduce costs for Super Chip.
